Smart cities are emerging as a priority for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) research and development across the world. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms have played a large part in automating and advancing city operations and aiding the development of CPS in cities. Increasingly, data-driven modeling and intelligent decision-making under uncertainty are forming the basis for advancing transportation, safety, connectivity, and health services. For example, advanced traffic solutions, improved public transportation systems, smart emergency response, energy modeling, and autonomous driving are some of the applications that have benefited from approaches to principled decision-making.

There are many challenges pertaining to decision-making for CPS in smart cities. With the advent of IoT, sensor data is being generated at a pace and volume that is difficult to process and make inferences from. Further, the needs of the cities dictate that much of the processing happens on the edge, making it imperative that fast and tractable approaches to decision-making are designed. At the same time, there is a growing need for automated applications to be fair, secure, and resilient. Participants in the workshop will exchange ideas on these and allied topics, including:


<ol>
<li><p>Forecasting and analysis for city-scale CPS:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Algorithms and frameworks for solving the challenge of integrating heterogeneous and cross-domain data.</p></li>
<li><p>Approaches for engaging communities, citizen science, and crowdsourcing, and subsequently using such uncertain and noisy information to make inferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Predictive analytics for smart cities; using data to inform policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Online approaches to consume streaming data generated across a multitude of devices and adapt to dynamic environments.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy modeling and forecasting, especially under the effects of climate change.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Decision-making for smart cities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Approaches to model complex decision-making tasks in smart cities and how they tackle uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>Principled heuristics to design scalable decision-making in city-scale CPS.</p></li>
<li><p>End-to-end decision-theoretic pipelines for managing applications in cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Proactive approaches to mitigate the effects of service disruptions, network failures, and power outages.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Secure and resilient cities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Interactions between privacy, security, resilience, reliability, and safety from both theoretical and operational perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Robustness of forecasting and decision-making approaches against adversarial behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Data safety and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasting rare infrastructure failures. Predict major infrastructure failures before they happen.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Open-source smart city datasets:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We highly encourage submissions of high quality city level data along with detailed description, usage, and analysis for sharing with the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Our goal is to setup a sub-site (on Kaggle, for example) exclusively for smart cities that can serve as a one-stop data source.</p></li>

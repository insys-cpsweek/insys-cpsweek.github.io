I am a research scientist at Vanderbilt University, USA, working with [Prof. Abhishek Dubey](https://scopelab.ai/). My research interests include multi-agent systems, robust machine learning, and decision-making under uncertainty. 

Prior to this, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab at Stanford University, USA, working under [Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/mykel-kochenderfer).  I was <b>awarded the 2019 CARS post-doctoral fellowship</b> by the [Center of Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS)](https://cars.stanford.edu/). Before joining Stanford, I was a PhD student at Vanderbilt University's Computational Economics Research Lab under [Prof. Eugene Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/). My thesis was <b>nominated for the Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award 2020</b>.  

I am particularly intersted in applying AI to real-world problems, especially ones that have societal impacts. Much of my disseration focussed on using AI to aid proactive emergency response. My current work focusses on designing decentralized decision-making systems for emergency response, understanding how crowdsourced reports can be used to infer emergency scenarios, and trying to understand how to tackle wildfires and heatwaves. Last quarter, I was one of the mentors for [Stanford's CS+Social Good Impact Lab](https://cs4good.com/), helping undergraduate students use AI for social good. I was also one of the members of Stanford's energy committee, working on using predictive models to understand energy needs on campus. 

If you are interested in any of these research areas, feel free to reach out. I am happy to chat, learn, help, and collaborate!

<b>Updates</b>

<ul>
    <li> We have created <b>WildfireDB</b>, the first open-source and comprehensive database with over 2 million data points, that links wildfire occurrences with relevant covariates extracted from satellite imagery. We will present details about the database at the AI for Earth Sciences workshop at NeurIPS 2020. See the paper <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/neurips20.pdf">here</a> and access the database <a href="https://wildfire-modeling.github.io/">here</a>.</li>
    <li> Our work on creating <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/aaai_wildfire.pdf">uncertainty aware wildfire management strategies</a> and <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/aaai_erm.pdf">designing principled emergency response pipelines</a> have been acepted to the AAAI Fall Symposium Series Workshop in AI for Social Good.</li>
    <li> I gave a tutorial on Smart Emergency Response at the <a href="http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2020/">NSF Computational Sustainability Doctorial Symposium 2020</a> on October 18. See the talk <a href="https://youtu.be/5OZszP4FTlw?t=354">here</a></li> 
    <li> I have been invited to be a PC member for AAMAS-21 and AAAI-21.</li> 
    <li> I gave a talk at the Utah Center for Data Science's Summer Seminar Series on the 19th of June about robust machine learning models and smart emergency response. See the poster <a href="http://datascience.utah.edu/assets/img/club_photos/SSS-2020-05.pdf">here</a>, and listen to the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIaj7szN5I&t=1143s">here</a></li>
    <li> I gave a talk about how robust incident prediction can combat poaching at the <a href="https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/148537">Cambridge Environmental Data Science Group's AI4ER Seminar Series</a> on the 30th of June.

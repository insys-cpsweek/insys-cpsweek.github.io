We invite full papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages), and concept papers (2 pages) on the following topics (all page limits include references):

<ol>
<li><p>Forecasting and analysis for city-scale CPS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Algorithms and frameworks for solving the challenge of integrating heterogeneous and cross-domain data.</li>
<li>Approaches for engaging communities, citizen science, and crowdsourcing, and subsequently using such uncertain and noisy information to make inferences.</li>
<li>Predictive analytics for smart cities; using data to inform policies.</li>
<li>Online approaches to consume streaming data generated across a multitude of devices and adapt to dynamic environments.</li>
<li>Energy modeling and forecasting, especially under the effects of climate change.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Decision-making for smart cities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Approaches to model complex decision-making tasks in smart cities and how they tackle uncertainty.</li>
<li>Principled heuristics to design scalable decision-making in city-scale CPS.</li>
<li>End-to-end decision-theoretic pipelines for managing applications in cities.</li>
<li>Proactive approaches to mitigate the effects of service disruptions, network failures, and power outages.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Secure and resilient cities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interactions between privacy, security, resilience, reliability, and safety from both theoretical and operational perspectives.</li>
<li>Robustness of forecasting and decision-making approaches against adversarial behavior.</li>
<li>Data safety and privacy.</li>
<li>Forecasting rare infrastructure failures. Predict major infrastructure failures before they happen.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Open-source smart city datasets:</p>
<ol>
<li>We highly encourage submissions of high quality city level data along with detailed description, usage, and analysis for sharing with the community.</li>
<li>Our goal is to setup a sub-site (on Kaggle, for example) exclusively for smart cities that can serve as a one-stop data source.</li>

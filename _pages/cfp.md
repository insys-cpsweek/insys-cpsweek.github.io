We invite full papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages), and concept papers (2 pages) on the following topics (all page limits include references). Authors can choose to include their papers in the ACM CPS Week proceedings or opt out. We welcome prior work published in conferences or journals.

<ol>
<li><p>Forecasting and analysis for city-scale CPS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Algorithms and frameworks for solving the challenge of integrating heterogeneous and cross-domain data.</li>
<li>Approaches for engaging communities, citizen science, and crowdsourcing, and subsequently using such uncertain and noisy information to make inferences.</li>
<li>Predictive analytics for smart cities; using data to inform policies.</li>
<li>Online approaches to consume streaming data generated across a multitude of devices and adapt to dynamic environments.</li>
<li>Energy modeling and forecasting, especially under the effects of climate change.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Decision-making for smart cities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Approaches to model complex decision-making tasks in smart cities and how they tackle uncertainty.</li>
<li>Principled heuristics to design scalable decision-making in city-scale CPS.</li>
<li>End-to-end decision-theoretic pipelines for managing applications in cities.</li>
<li>Proactive approaches to mitigate the effects of service disruptions, network failures, and power outages.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Secure and resilient cities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interactions between privacy, security, resilience, reliability, and safety from both theoretical and operational perspectives.</li>
<li>Robustness of forecasting and decision-making approaches against adversarial behavior.</li>
<li>Data safety and privacy.</li>
<li>Forecasting rare infrastructure failures. Predict major infrastructure failures before they happen.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Open-source smart city datasets:</p>
<ol>
<li>We highly encourage submissions of high quality city level data along with detailed description, usage, and analysis for sharing with the community.</li>
<li>Our goal is to setup a sub-site (on Kaggle, for example) exclusively for smart cities that can serve as a one-stop data source.</li>

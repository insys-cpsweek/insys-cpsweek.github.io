1. I gave a talk at the Utah Center for Data Science's Summer Seminar Series on the 19th of June about robust machine learning models and smart emergency response. See the poster <a href="http://datascience.utah.edu/assets/img/club_photos/SSS-2020-05.pdf">here</a>, and listen to the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIaj7szN5I&t=1143s">here</a>


2. I gave a talk about how robust incident prediction can combat poaching at the <a href="https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/148537">Cambridge Environmental Data Science Group's AI4ER Seminar Series</a> on the 30th of June.

4. Our research was covered in an [article on smart cities](https://www.ft.com/content/140ae3f0-1b6f-11ea-81f0-0c253907d3e0) by Financial Times.

4. Our work was covered in the Government Technology Magazine as part of it's "MetroLab Innovation of the Month Series". Check out the article [here](https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Data-Drives-Down-Nashvilles-Emergency-Response-Times.html).

5. A relatively non-technical overview of my work from the AI for Social Good Workshop at AAAI's Spring Symposium 2017 can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96QExCTpBbI&t=51m0s).

6. Our work was showcased as part of the [Global City Teams Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/GCTC/event/gctc-expo-2017/exhibit/), a global smart city symposium. See the poster [here](http://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/postergctc.pdf).

## Abstract
In urban areas across the globe, incidents like crime, fire and accidents often result in massive losses of life and property. In such scenarios, quick response can minimize or prevent damage. Emergency responder services are eager to adopt mechanisms that aid real-time decision making in the field. With limited resources however, it is imperative that resource allocation and dispatch decision are taken in a systematic and principled manner. This problem gives rise to challenges that are both technically intriguing and have immense applicability in practice. In this paper, I describe how my research seeks to identify problems in this space and addresses them. I also describe some of the existing challenges in the domain and potential approaches that could be used to tackle such problems.
